# About me:

Sup guys, my name is Alex.)

Do u remember this song with this words: '..yesterday, the girl declared: either her or the game, but there's no doubt here, I choose the internet..'?  
Its all about me. xD

And if you're serious... I'm 37 years old, a beginner data scientist. After a long period of wandering and self-discovery I spat and decided to do what I do best: stare at a computer and hammer on the keys.))  
Why data science? I love automating, optimizing, improving. It seems like this profession is all about that. I don't have much to be proud of yet, but I have plenty of discipline and determination, so why not – what are my years for?))

I'm also skilled in photography, videography, playing the guitar, psychology, fitness and I travel a lot. And years of videogames.)) Can make flip to the pool. xD

Such a dating site turned out for me here ...))
Well, in short.
The readme will be updated several times, so for now I will leave this 'about me'.) It is necessary to lay out the project and not lose face with the design of the github.))

Right now I use only one language: Python. In the macro perspective, I will study Java and Javascript, it is also possible C/+/-/%20. xD  
And of course html + css, where without it?))

Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention... I'm Russian, so project descriptions and code comments will be in Russian for now. However, I plan to transition to English over time.
